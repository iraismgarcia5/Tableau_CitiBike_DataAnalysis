# Citi Bike Analytics

The task for this assignment was to aggrefate the data fround in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs from [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage and find unexpected phenomena. Each phenomena would be accompanied by 2-5 visualizations created in Tableau.

This assignment tested our creativity to dig through the data by visualizing it and drawing conclusions from the visuals presented.

The final product was a Tableau story with dashboards and one city official map. The interactive storyboard can be accessed [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/irais5320#!/vizhome/CitiBikeAnalytics_15818234393640/Story1) on Tableau Public.
